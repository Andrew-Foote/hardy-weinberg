A simulation illustrating the Hardy-Weinberg principle and genetic drift. The simulation is of a finite population of organisms which mate randomly and have a genetic code consisting of a single locus with two alleles, A (dominant) and a (recessive). If the population is sufficiently large and the simulation is not run for too long, the allele and genotype frequencies remain constant according to the Hardy-Weinberg principle; but if the population is not large enough and the simulation is run for a long time one allele will eventually vanish from the population due to genetic drift.
